# UI5 Showcases

This app showcases how UI5 is being used. It is implemented with UI5 itself. We already have a number of representative showcases for you to explore. Play around with them interactively, or simply browse them in presentation mode. There’s enough interesting content to see how flexible and versatile UI5 technology can be.

Do you have a great showcase you want to share? Perfect! It’s easy to contribute and add it to the portfolio.
